## Usage

## Installation
### Pip + Virtualenv

An alternative to Conda is to use pip and virtualenv to manage your environments.
This may play less nicely with Windows, but works fine on Unix devices.
This method makes use of the `requirements.txt` file.

Ensure you have installed the [virtualenv tool](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/installation.html) on your system.
Once installed, create a new virtual environment:

    vitualenv ~/competition2-ift6390-venv
    source ~/competition2-ift6390-venv/bin/activate

Install the packages from a requirements.txt file:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

As before, register the environment so jupyter can see it:

    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=competition2-ift6390-venv

You should now be able to launch jupyter and see your conda environment:

    jupyter-lab

If you want to create a new `requirements.txt` file, you can use `pip freeze`:

    pip freeze > requirements.txt
